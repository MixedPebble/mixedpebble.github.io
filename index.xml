I intervened four times to address unsafe conditions that, in retrospect, the car would have dealt with sufficiently. With those exceptions, the most work I had to do was navigate off highways to reach superchargers. Overall, it was a fantastic drive where I could pay attention to the road while relaxing, which, oddly enough, allowed me to stay alert despite such a long drive.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hello There Hi, my name is Daniel Jackson.
