- History
  - February 2021 I bought my 2019 Tesla Model 3 with the Full Self Driving (FSD) package in Portland, Oregon
  - In a single 15 hour, 1000 mile drive, I made my down route 5 to Los Angeles, California
  - Nearly the entire journey was done entirely with the FSD package.
  - I manually interveened four times due to unsafe conditions caused by other drivers
  - In retrospect, the car probably would have handled these situations flawlessly but given my knowledge and experience at the time, it was more sensible to take over. 
  - There was no need to risk lives and my car over mild curiosity and even now, I likely would take over in similiar situations to be on the safe side.
  - With those exceptions, the drive was fantastic. Without any human intervention, the car drove itself the entire length of the drive, leaving me to enjoy the scenery.

- Difference between autopilot, FSD, FSD beta
  - At the time of the journey, there were 2 levels of autonomous driving in Tesla vehicles, basic autopilot and Full Self Driving (FSD)
  - Autopilot will, as the name implies, keep the vehicle safely in your lane and match your speed to traffic. It is best suited for highways.
  - FSD does the same as autopilot and more
    - Guides car from on-ramps to off-ramps, knowing which exits to take and what lane to be in
    - Safely and autonomously change lanes to pass slow traffic
    - Identifies traffic lights and follows them accordingly
    - Automatic parking and parallel parking
  - Contrary to the name, this system is very, very dependant on the driver.
    - When encountering winding roads, it will often overturn, sometimes into the wrong lane, requiring the driver to take over immediately
    - On roundabouts, it rarely works, often asking the user to take over immediately
    - The FSD system will not even activate on private roads such as parking lots or driveways.
    - It can't handle, parking lots, winding roads, right or left turns, and city streets
    

- AutoPilot
  - The basic autopilot comes with the vehicle and while it is great, it is hardly unique. Other brands already have their version of it and the technology for it has been around for nearly 30 years.
  - The technology for basic autopilot was created in 1993 by a South Korean professor, Min-hong Han, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlqM2KXbghU
  - This isn't to say that it isn't great, but there are other brands one could consider if this is a key feature for them.

- FSD
  - The FSD costs, at the time of writing, $10,000 to buy outright per vehicle or $200/month through a subscription. 
  - In my opinion, this is hardly worth it as the navigation is only available on highways.
  - The summon & smart summon features are used more often as gimmicks
  - The feature that may make it worth the price tag is the autosteering on city streets but unfortunately, that is unavailable and has been promised "within the year" for over a year now.

- FSD Beta
  - In October 2021, a new beta version of the FSD package was introduced to a limited amount of drivers and has gradually expanded to an estimated 10-15 thousand vehicles
  - The FSD beta can be opted into by anyone with the FSD package. 
  - To be accepted into the beta program the driver must drive around for at least 100 miles in the past 30 days and have a 98/100 or better safety rating
  - The driver is evaluated on hard turns, unsafe following distance, hard braking, forward collision warning, and how often autopilot is automatically disengaged
  - this program makes the FSD package worth the price.
  -  

- FSD Beta continued
  - Only having had the FSD beta for less than a month, the difference between the base FSD and the FSD beta is the difference between night and day.
  - While the base FSD is limited to straightaways, the FSD beta is almost completely autonomous, capable of accomplishing all of the shortcomings that the standard FSD 
    - It can navigate from your driveway to almost any destination without any human interaction.
    - It can handle, parking lots, winding roads, right or left turns, and city streets
  - At the end of December, I made a 121-mile trek from my driveway to Albany, NY. 
  - The FSD beta successfully drove the car from my driveway to the supercharger station near Colonie Mall without any human interaction.
  - This trip included suburban roads, highways, and city driving.
  - This trip had winding backroads, right and left turns at both stop signs and major intersections as well as city streets.
  - Any cause for concern proved unfounded even in unexpected situations such as following  "Slow Down and Move Over" laws at the site of accidents

- FSD Beta continued
  - While the FSD Beta is far from perfect, it only requires the driver to intervene occassionally and handles most situations very well.
  - The list of items the FSD beta needs improvement is reminiscent of one you may give to a great yet overly cautious driver.
  - The FSD beta perhaps too cautiously approaches turns at intersections, occasionally garnering honks from the next car.
  - [Insert student driver sticker]

- End thoughts
  - Anyone considering the autopilot or the Full Self Driving Package and its beta variant may want to consider saving their money and sticking with the basic autopilot.
  - While the FSD beta package is without question the most advanced autonomous driving system in the world, it does not warrant the $10,000 price tag for most drivers
  - Instead, the recently introduced FSD subscription option is perfectly suited for most drivers to enjoy on road trips.
