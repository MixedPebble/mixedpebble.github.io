- The basic idea is to hit d4 to prevent white from playing d4 and controlling the center

## Common Variations
  - Look up most common responses after c5
    - Open Sicilian:
        - Played X% of the time
        - After 1. White brings the king's knight out and then push the d4 pawn. The trade will put white's knight in the center
        - The general goal for white is to allow for rapid development
    - Closed Sicilian:
        - Played X % of the time 
    -  Dragon
    - French (me!)
        - White can try going for c3 then d5 (me!), with the goal of getting two pawns in the center
## What decisions/types of play can white/black go for:
-  How to make it opened/closed


# Notes
- Prevents white from controlling 4 squares in blacks territory
- Creates an asymmetrical (unbalanced) position.
- It stops white from getting the ideal center
- With the sicilain, black tends
- Complex, unbalnced positions, black has the opportunity to seize the initiative early in the game
- Most defenses, black must survive white's attack then press for an advantage. With this opening, black may be able to attack early on.
- With the c pawn out, black is declaring his intentions to control space on the queen side. This does allow white to do the same on the king side.
- Each side will attack where they have space. White on the king, black on the queen.
- This style of opening is a black half-open defense. Half open games 
- The normal e5 opening, opens up the bishop and queen while also setting up to castle the king. 
  - c5 does none of that. Instead, it makes an attack from the flank. It only helps develop the queen.
  - Nothing happens with the King side minor pieces, making black work for development.
- Important: White's attack will be centered on king side. Black's attack will be centered on Queen side.
- In most open sicilian variations, whites D pawn gets traded for blacks C spawn. 
  - Regardless of the other moves leading up to this, imagine just those two pieces removed. Black is better off.
  - This typically becomes relavent in the end game where black has more central pawns.


- Because black isn't directly contesting the center, black will need to commit to several early pawn moves to solidify his defense. 
  - Typically a combination of the a,d,e, and g pawn.
- "If black manages to survive the opening and black plays properly and gets to trade off some pieces and gets into an endgame.
  Black is going to be better because of his positional advantage of the central pawn majority"

# To look into
- What is the ideal center?
- What type of opening is this? Aggressive? Safe?
