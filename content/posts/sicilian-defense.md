# Template
## Intro:

- The basic Sicilian (1. e4, c5)
- The basic idea is to hit d4 to prevent white from playing d4 and controlling the center



## Common Variations
  - Look up most common responses after c5
    - Open Sicilian:
        - Played X% of the time
        - After 1. White brings the king's knight out and then push the d4 pawn. The trade will put white's knight in the center
        - The general goal for white is to allow for rapid development
    - Closed Sicilian:
        - Played X % of the time 
    -  Dragon
    - French (me!)
        - White can try going for c3 then d5 (me!), with the goal of getting two pawns in the center
## What decisions/types of play can white/black go for:
-  How to make it opened/closed


# Notes
- Prevents white from controlling 4 squares in blacks territory
- Creates an asymmetrical (unbalanced) position.
- It stops white from getting the ideal center
- With the sicilain, black tends
- Complex, unbalnced positions, black has the opportunity to seize the initiative early in the game
- Most defenses, black must survive white's attack then press for an advantage. With this opening, black may be able to attack early on.
- With the c pawn out, black is declaring his intentions to control space on the queen side. This does allow white to do the same on the king side.
- Each side will attack where they have space. White on the king, black on the queen.
- This style of opening is a black half-open defense. Half open games 

# To look into
- What is the ideal center?
- What type of opening is this? Aggressive? Safe?
