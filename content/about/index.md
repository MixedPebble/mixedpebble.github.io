# [Hello There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEMSKzqGAg)

Hi, my name is Daniel Jackson and I am a software engineer. This blog is a fun and constructive way for me to get my thoughts in order and reinforce what I have learnt and what I am learning.

Since this is for self-betterment and not self-advertisement, I'll keep this short. I studied Computer Science and Applied Math Economics so most posts will be focused on these topics.

If you have any questions, comments or critiques of any of my posts, pleaes feel free to reach out to me at <danielKJackson95@gmail.com> or leave a comment on the post!
