## [Hello There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEMSKzqGAg)

Hi, my name is Daniel Jackson. I live in New York and am a software engineer by trade. This blog is a fun and constructive way to get my thoughts in order and reinforce what I have and am learning.

Since this is for self-betterment and not self-advertisement, I'll keep this short. I studied Computer Science and Applied Math Economics which is what most posts will be on. I've found that the most effective way to become fluent in a subject is to learn the theory through application. Whether as an accessory or alternative, composing one's thoughts by putting pen to paper is an excellent method to accomplish this.

If you have any comments or critiques, please reach out to <danielKJackson95@gmail.com> or leave a comment on the post!
