I live in New York and am a software engineer by trade. This blog is a fun and constructive way to get my thoughts in order and reinforce what I have and am learning.\nSince this is for self-betterment and not self-advertisement, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this short. I studied Computer Science and Applied Math Economics which is what most posts will be on. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the most effective way to become fluent in a subject is to learn the theory through application. Whether as an accessory or alternative, composing one\u0026rsquo;s thoughts by putting pen to paper is an excellent method to accomplish this.\nIf you have any comments or critiques, please reach out to danielKJackson95@gmail.com or leave a comment on the post!\n","date":"Feb 28, 2019","img":"","permalink":"/about/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","date":"Jan 1, 0001","img":"","permalink":"/offline/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Offline"}]
